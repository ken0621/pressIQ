Brown Rewards Plan
1)	Brown MLM Plan
The Brown MLM Plan, like other Multi-level Marketing Plans is a compensation plan where participants or members are compensated upon achieving a set level of width and depth in the sale of products. 
However, Brown is unique in that it is set up to the simplest 1x2 achievement level.  That means  a member will only need to recruit 2 members by selling Brown products, in order to earn rewards. Each member is allowed only up to 2 members as immediate downline (level2 of same tree) but will be compensated up to 12 levels where he/she is the 1st level of a “Brown Tree.”

2)	Brown Compensation Plan Rewards.  There are  2 ways to earn from a Brown tree. 
Direct Referral Rewards,  where you directly refer a new Member, and you are registered as the Referrer/Sponsor.
Pairing Rewards, when 2 recruits form a pair under a common upline within your Brown Tree.

3)	The following rewards per Brown Tree may be earned:

a)	Direct Referral Reward: Php500.00
b)	Pairing Reward : Php500.00

4) Safety Net of 12 Levels. 
Earnings stop on the 12th level with a member being the 1st level of your tree. 
Total of 4,095 members per Brown Tree, consisting of 1 member on the 1st level and 2048 members on the 12th level. 
5)	Spill over
Defined as an instance of overflowing or spreading into another area. The spilling over of your recruits to the next available level within your tree as a result of size constraint of the levels. 
Wikipedia- Spillover. The profits of gaining a new member is shared between the entire high-line, which encourages everyone to attempt to recruit new members and make the binary plan larger
In network marketing the term is used to describe a situation where, after signing up the maximum number of recruits permitted on your first level, any person you sign after this maximum 'spills over' to the next level. And if the next level is also filled, to the one following it.
5)	Pay-Out .  There will be a Brown Member’s Dashboard where earnings may be viewed by members. and transferred to EON every 7th and 22nd of the month after the 15days clearing/cut-off.
