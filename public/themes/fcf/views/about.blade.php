						FCF Minerals Corporation (FCF) was incorporated in the Philippines and was duly registered with the Philippine SEC on December 3, 2001 to engage in continuing exploration, development and commercial operation of mineral claims with full power and authority to do any and all acts, things, business and activities which are related, incidental or conducive directly or indirectly to the attainment of the foregoing objectives as a mining company.<br><br>

						In 2009, the Company converted its exploration permit into a Financial or Technical Assistance Agreement (FTAA) with the Philippine Government. This agreement covers an initial terms of twenty five (25) years and renewable for another twenty five (25) years thereafter. Under the FTAA, the Company was granted the exclusive rights to explore, mine, utilize, process, refine, market, transport, export and dispose of minerals and mineral products and by-products that may be derived or produced from the contract area containing 3,093 hectares located in Barangay Runruno, Quezon, Nueva Vizcaya, Philippines. The FTAA was registered with the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB) on October 28, 2009.<br><br>

						In March 2010, the company received the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) for its Runruno Gold-Molybdenum Project, which was issued after satisfactory evaluation of the project’s Environmental Impact Statement by the Philippine Environmental Management Bureau.
						In 2011, the Company acquired the final permit to proceed to development and construction phase of its Runruno Gold-Molybdenum Project after the DENR approved its Declaration of Mining Project Feasibility (DMPF).<br><br>

						Metals Exploration Plc, a company registered in the United Kingdom, owns 100% of FCF Minerals Corporation and the Runruno Gold-Molybdenum Project.

						FCF works to add value the communities we operate within and believe that by being an excellent corporate citizen can optimise long-term prosperity of both local people our shareholders community relations activities are coordinated Runruno Livelihood Foundation a non-profit organisation jointly financed by FCF and the Philippine government and run by a dedicated team.<br><br>

						The RLF was created to establish and maintain a series of livelihood development projects for local residents. These activities range from the provision of trained teachers for local schools and feeding programs for undernourished children, vocational courses, social infrastructures like day care centers and medical services to include the establishment of a village drug store and first aid training.
						In addition, the Company prides itself on a strong ethic of environmental responsibility. All projects are designed with long-term sustainability in mind and seek to promote environmentally friendly practices. All of our field operations comply with international regulatory guidelines and we work to ensure that we cause minimum negative impact on our working environment.<br><br>

						As a result of these efforts, it was reported in a provincial mining summit on October 24, 2007 by Albert Jacildo (then MGB Regional Director) during the visit of DENR Secretary Lito Atienza to Nueva Viscaya that “there are no issues raised against the project”. He also praised Metals Exploration for its outstanding community development and information programme. As the Runruno project progresses we will continue to strengthen our community relations activities to provide ongoing support to those within the project area.<br><br>

						As FCF Minerals continues to set the standards in social and environmental responsibility in the mining industry in the Philippines, it has garnered series of awards and recognition both nationally and internationally. Recently, FCF won the Best Community Development Initiative Award at the Asia Mining Congress in Singapore.

						RUNRUNO LIVELYHOOD FOUNDATION
					</div>
					<p>
						The Runruno project has a very strong community development component with a continuing commitment to behave ethically and contribute to local economic development, while improving the quality of life of its stakeholders and the society at large.<br><br>

						The implementation of the CSR program goes beyond the statutory obligations laid down in the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 and is a voluntary gesture of a company endeavouring to become a positive neighbour. To implement this philosophy, FCF Minerals established the Runruno Livelihood Foundation (The Foundation or RLF) to be its community development arm, which was tasked to establish a strong and lasting relationship with local stakeholders while at the same time fulfilling its commitments to the host communities.<br><br>

						The primary rationale for setting up the Foundation was to separate community development efforts from exploration and mining operations. The Foundation has an entirely separate budget and organization. The Foundation has 11 regular staff and 14 volunteer workers from different disciplines. It is headed by Dr Ernesto Mendoza, a senior executive with more than 35 years experience in managing CSR programs. Ernesto was awarded the Mining Journal’s 2007 Outstanding Achievement award in London for “remarkable work done in the host community of Runruno during the aftermath of Typhoon Paeng” in November of 2006 which buried most parts of the village with a mudslide and where several residents lost their lives. Very recently, FCF community development programs earned further recognition at the Asia Mining Congress in Singapore by winning the Best Community Development Initiative Award, beating other companies including Centerra Gold and PT Freeport of Indonesia.<br><br>

						The Foundation focuses on empowering people so that they are able to help themselves, and supports local improvement programs in education and skills development, health care, sanitation, employment, environmental awareness and literacy. These projects are jointly financed by FCF Minerals in partnership with various local government agencies and managed by a dedicated team of local people. It was officially registered with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 2006 under SEC Registration No. CN200612122.<br><br>

						<p style="font-weight: 700;">Current RLF Projects</p>

						One of the current community development projects of the Foundation is its program focused on the Out-of-School Youth (OSY) which won the Best Community Development Initiative Award during the Asia Mining Congress on March 25, 2009 in Singapore. This was the first time an entry from the Philippines had won the award.  The OSY program has to date trained, equipped and employed some 640 OSYs, the majority of which are from the province of Nueva Viscaya, while the others are from the nearby provinces.<br><br>

						In 2008 this particular initiative won the Kabalikat Award from the Office of the President of the Republic of the Philippines, through the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) Region 2. FCF Minerals Corporation was a regional winner because it was recognized for its outstanding contribution to the promotion and enhancement of technical education and skills development. FCF was honoured as an industry partner for focusing on the promotion and development of the country’s middle level manpower.<br><br>

						The Foundation is also currently implementing projects in areas such as the environment, local infrastructure, employment generation, agriculture and skills generation.<br><br>

					The work done by FCF Minerals Corporation at the Runruno project has attracted series of awards and recognition both internationally and nationally.<br><br>

					<p style="font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">International Awards</p>

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">Mining Journal Outstanding Achievement Award:</p>

					The Mining Journal 2007 Outstanding Achievement Award was won by Dr. Ernesto Mendoza, FCF’s Senior Vice President, in awards ceremonies held in London for “remarkable work in assisting the community of Runruno, Quezon in Nueva Viscaya, Philippines in recovery from the effects of Super Typhoon “Paeng” in November 2006. This award is given to those who have exhibited long time charity work and for championing the mining industry. Dr. Mendoza is the first Filipino to win the award.<br><br>

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">Best Community Development Initiative Award (Asia Mining Congress – Singapore)</p>

					FCF received the award during the Asia Mining Congress Sustainability Awards 2009 at Singapore last March 25, 2009. FCF Minerals won by organizing a community development initiative that truly embodies what a community development project should be. The initiative is called Out-of-School Youth (OSY) Skills Development and Placement Program which was conceived in the light of the current economic climate that saw many overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) lose their jobs abroad. To date, 640 OSYs (from various mountain ethnic tribes) have received training and employment through the FCF program. The program was judged as strategic, relevant, sustainable and with broad-based participation from the concerned stakeholders.<br><br>

					<p style="font-family: 'Fjalla One', sans-serif; font-size: 20px;">National Awards</p>

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">Presidential Mineral Industry Enviromental Award (PMIEA)</p>

					For two years in a row FCF was awarded the PMIEA for its active role as a responsible mining company. It received its first PMIEA in 2011, the year when FCF bagged 3 of the top awards in the Exploration Category at the 58th Annual National Mine Safety and Environment Conference (ANMSEC) held yearly in Baguio City. The second PMIEA was given in 2012. The PMIEA award was created through Executive Order No. 374 “to promote the efficient management of the environment and ecology in the exploration, development and utilization of the country’s mineral resources.”<br><br>

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">Safest Mines Award – Exploration Category</p>

					In 2011, FCF Minerals Corporation also won the Safest Mines Awards – Exploration Category “A” after it achieved its 2-Million Manhours Without a Lost Time Accident and for keeping exploration activities free from incidents that could have affected work time during its exploration activities.<br><br>

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">Mining Forest Award</p>
					Also in 2012 and 2011, FCF Minerals Corporation won the 1st Runner Up (Exploration Category) recognition in the Best Mining Forest that acknowleged the company’s successful implementation of its Integrated Mining Reforestation Program. Since 2008, the company has been consistently winning this accolade. The award was given based primarily on nursery operations, extent of area planted, protection and maintenance within the exploration area.<br><br>

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">Platinum Award</p>
					FCF Minerals also won the Platinum Award (Exploration Category) for exemplary performance in environmental management, which was awarded during the same event (ANMSEC).

					<p style="font-weight: 700;">The Kabalikat Award</p>

					The Kabalikat Award was presented to FCF Minerals Corporation by the Office of the President of the Philippines, through the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) as a Regional Winner (Region 2) in August 2008. FCF Minerals Corporation was selected as a winner because it was recognized for outstanding contributions to the promotion and enhancement of technical education and skills development. FCF was honoured as an industry partner for focusing in the promotion and development of the country’s middle level manpower.
